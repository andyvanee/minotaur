# Minotaur

a minimalistic, bootstrap-compatible, CSS framework

See <http://andyvanee.github.io/minotaur/> for demo and usage. **currently broken**

----

**Note**: I started this project started before Bootstrap 3 came out, and they
basically implemented all of the things that I had done here (symmetric and
nest-able grids, among other things). I am currently converting this to implement
a small subset of bootstrap features, while keeping the same variable names and
classes to allow upgrading your project to the full bootstrap. Minotaur is to
Bootstrap what Zepto is to jQuery.
