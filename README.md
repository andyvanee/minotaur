a minimalistic CSS framework

See <http://andyvanee.github.io/minotaur/> for demo and usage.

**Note**: I abandoned this project once Bootstrap3 came out, since they had basically implemented all of the things that I had done here (symmetric and nest-able grids, among other things). The size of BS3 is pretty big though, so I've taken to `@import`-ing only what I need.

Changes are coming to this effect.
